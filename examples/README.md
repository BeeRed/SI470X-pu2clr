# Examples


[This folder](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI470X/tree/master/examples) has some examples that might help you to use the Si470X Arduino Library in your receiver project. If you find some error or problem during your implementation, please let me know. 

__This project is about a library to control the SI4701/02/03 devices and the focus of this project is the library and its functionalities. Please, don't ask me to assist you in your: displays, encoders, buttons or something else out the library scope. Thanks.__

The [si470x_01_serial_monitor](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI470X/tree/master/examples/si470x_01_serial_monitor) folder shows how you can check your circuit by using just the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor to control the receiver. 

Tge [si470x_02_TFT_display](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI470X/tree/master/examples/si470x_02_TFT_display) folder has an example with the traditional Display TFT based on ST7735. 


The schematic below shows the receiver example with TFT display, encoder and push buttons.
